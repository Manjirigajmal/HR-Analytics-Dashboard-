### üß† Problem Statement
Organizations face challenges in understanding why employees leave and which workforce groups are most affected by attrition.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Approach
1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Used a synthetic HR dataset of 550 employees and 10 attributes.  
   - Cleaned and validated data types (Age, Salary, Performance Rating, Experience, Attrition).  
   - Created derived fields such as *Age Group* and *Experience Buckets*.

2. **Modeling and DAX:**  
   - Built calculated columns and measures for Attrition %, Average Salary, Avg Tenure, and Department-specific KPIs.  
   - Developed dynamic text measures for tooltips and contextual titles using DAX.

3. **Visualization Design:**  
   - Implemented a clean three-page structure:  
     - **Page 1 ‚Äì Overview Dashboard**  
     - **Page 2 ‚Äì Department Analysis (Drill-through)**  
     - **Page 3 ‚Äì Dynamic Tooltip Insights**  
   - Applied a consistent color theme (Deep Purple, Lavender, Teal, Coral).  
   - Added slicers synced across pages for Department, Gender, Education, and Job Role.

4. **Insight Storytelling:**  
   - Arranged visuals in a logical narrative order: KPIs ‚Üí Trends ‚Üí Distributions ‚Üí Comparisons.  
   - Added tooltips that summarize live insights like highest attrition department, avg salary, and gender-based attrition.
